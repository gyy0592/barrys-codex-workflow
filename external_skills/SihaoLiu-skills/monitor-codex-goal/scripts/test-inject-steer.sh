# These exercise the pure verification helpers (no tmux, no live pane). The focus
# is the COLLAPSED BRACKETED PASTE case: Codex's TUI renders a long paste in its
# composer as a single placeholder line "[Pasted Content <N> chars]" instead of
# echoing the literal text. The literal tail-signature is then never visible, so
# `type` must accept the placeholder (when N ~ the file's codepoint count), and
# `submit` must watch THAT placeholder leave the composer after Enter rather than
# the literal signature (which was never in the box). Short pastes still render
# inline and use the literal tail-signature path; both paths are covered here.
